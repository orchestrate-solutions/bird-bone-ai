# Requirements Directory

This directory contains files specifying the dependencies for the Bird-Bone AI project. These are "living specifications" that evolve with the project.

## Contents

- **`requirements.txt`**: A primary file listing core Python package dependencies, often generated by tools like `pip-tools`.
- **`environment.yml`**: A Conda environment file for reproducing the development environment, including Python versions and channel specifications.
- **Specific Requirement Files**: Potentially separate files for different environments or purposes (e.g., `requirements-dev.txt`, `requirements-gpu.txt`).
- These files ensure reproducibility and consistent environments across development and deployment.
