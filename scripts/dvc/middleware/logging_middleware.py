"""
DVC Logging Middleware
=====================

Purpose:
    Provides comprehensive logging functionality for DVC operations, tracking
    operation progress, timing, and context flow through the chain.

Input Context Requirements:
    - Any context (works with all contexts)

Output Context Modifications:
    - Adds timing information to context if enabled
    - No destructive modifications to context

Error Conditions:
    - Logging failures are suppressed to avoid breaking the chain

Dependencies:
    - logging: Standard Python logging module
    - time: For operation timing

Side Effects:
    - Writes log messages to configured logger
    - Measures and optionally stores operation timing

Example Usage:
    Applied as middleware to any ModuLink chain to provide automatic logging
    of all operations with detailed context information.
