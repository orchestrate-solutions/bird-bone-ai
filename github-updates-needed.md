## Issues Requiring Updates

### Terminology Changes
- **Old**: Bird-Bone Compression (BBCF), growth plates, post-training support weights
- **New**: Bird-Bone Density Reduction (BBDR), adaptive density loss, healing cycles

### GitHub CLI Commands to Execute

```bash
# Update issue labels
gh issue list --label "BBCF" --json number,title | jq -r '.[] | "\(.number)"' | xargs -I {} gh issue edit {} --remove-label "BBCF" --add-label "BBDR"

# Update issues mentioning old terminology
gh issue list --search "growth plates" --json number,title | jq -r '.[] | "\(.number)"' | while read issue; do
  echo "Issue #$issue needs manual review for terminology updates"
done

# Search for issues containing old objective names
gh issue list --search "Bird-Bone Compression" --json number,title,body
gh issue list --search "Biophase Adaptive Pruning" --json number,title,body
```

### Manual Review Required
- [x] Issues mentioning "growth plates" → update to "density loss cycles" (Issues #13, #14 updated)
- [x] Issues referencing "BBCF" → update to "BBDR" (Label updates completed)
- [x] Issues about "post-training support weights" → update to "redundant neural pathways" (No issues found)
- [x] Pipeline stage descriptions → update to reflect density loss methodology (Issue #17 updated)
### Affected Areas Likely to Have Issues
1. Core compression algorithm implementations
2. Pipeline configuration documentation
3. Pruning methodology discussions
4. Biologically-inspired design patterns
5. Performance benchmarking criteria
