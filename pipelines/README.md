# Pipelines Directory

This directory contains the data processing and machine learning pipelines for the Bird-Bone AI project.

## Contents

- **Kedro/Airflow DAGs**: Definitions for pipelines orchestrated using Kedro or Apache Airflow. These describe the sequence of operations, dependencies, and data flow.
- **ModuLink Chain Definitions**: Core logic for compression and other AI workflows, structured as ModuLink functional chains.
- Subdirectories for different pipeline stages or epics (e.g., `pipelines/epic1_foundation`, `pipelines/data_preprocessing`).
