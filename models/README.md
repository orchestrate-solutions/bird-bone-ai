# Models Directory

This directory is for storing versioned model checkpoints and related artifacts for the Bird-Bone AI project.

## Contents

- **Model Checkpoints**: Saved states of trained models (e.g., `.pt`, `.safetensors`, `.h5` files). These are typically versioned using DVC (Data Version Control) and/or Git LFS.
- **Tokenizers and Vocabularies**: Files related to text processing components of models.
- **Model Cards**: Documentation providing details about specific models, their performance, biases, and intended use cases.
- Subdirectories for different model architectures or experiments.
