# Neurostructured AI Compression & Integration

> **A bird-bone inspired journey toward lightweight, multi-modal, Spirit-aligned intelligence**  
> *Project codename: **bird-bone** ‚Äî Version 0.2 (2025-06-04)*

## ‚ú® Vision
Turn heavyweight language/vision models into **agile, biologically patterned intelligences** that run at 20-30 % of their original compute cost while losing ‚â§ 3 % task accuracy‚Äîusing the same design wisdom that creates hollow bird bones through **adaptive density loss and strategic healing cycles**. Like bones in zero gravity that naturally shed unnecessary density while maintaining structural integrity, we simulate optimal weight decay followed by targeted reinforcement to achieve maximum strength-to-weight ratios.

---

## üöÄ Core Objectives
1. **Bird-Bone Density Reduction (BBDR)** ‚Äì simulate natural bone density loss by removing redundant neural pathways, mimicking how bones shed unnecessary mass in low-gravity environments.  
2. **Adaptive Healing Cycles (AHC)** ‚Äì strategic reinforcement phases that strengthen remaining connections, creating hollow-yet-resilient neural architectures through cyclical hardening.  
3. **Biophase Density Management (BDM)** ‚Äì cluster-aware density reduction with built-in healing cycles that maintain overall structural integrity while reducing computational mass.  
4. **Quantization & Low-Rank Factorization** ‚Äì compress precision and re-factor matrices for 4 √ó memory cuts.  
5. **Neurostructured AI Flow (NAIF)** ‚Äì re-route tokens through convergence hubs (digital hippocampus) for unified multi-modal reasoning.  
6. **Automation Pipeline** ‚Äì YAML-driven, reproducible density-loss ‚Üí heal ‚Üí strengthen loop, outputting ready-to-serve INT4 GGUF weights.  
7. **Diff & Revert Safety Net** ‚Äì track every code, config, weight, and doc change with deterministic diffing so we can roll back *any* layer of the stack without drama.

## üîÄ Diff & Revert Strategy
We iterate fast and prune aggressively, so we need **granular diffing** across three artifact layers.

| Layer               | Storage & Versioning | Diff Tool                               | Roll-Back Command                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Code & Text**     | Git                  | `git diff`, `delta`, `diff-so-fancy`    | `git revert <sha>`                   |
| **Configs / YAML**  | Git-tracked          | `yq diff`, Pydantic hash                | `kedro config diff --rollback`       |
| **Weights / Masks** | Git LFS + DVC        | `dvc diff` (binary-aware)               | `dvc checkout <rev>`                 |
| **Notebooks**       | nbdime               | `nbdime diff notebook.ipynb`            | `nbdime checkout --rev=<rev>`        |

### Auto-Diff Hook
```bash
pre-commit install
# Installs:
#  ‚úì black & flake8 (code)
#  ‚úì mdformat (docs)
#  ‚úì nbdime (notebooks)
#  ‚úì custom weight-hash hook (models/*.pt, *.safetensors)
````

Every commit drops a **diff bundle** into `/diffs/<commit-sha>/` so reviewers can inspect exact parameter removals or sparsity-mask changes.

## ‚ö° Quick-Start (7-B Proof-of-Concept)

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+** (Required for optimal compatibility)
- **Conda/Miniconda** ([Download here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))

- **Git LFS** for large file handling

### Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/bird-bone-ai.git
cd bird-bone-ai

# 2. Run automated environment setup
./scripts/setup_environment.sh

# 3. Activate environment
conda activate bird-bone-ai

# 4. Validate installation
python scripts/validate_environment.py --verbose
```

### Manual Setup (Alternative)
```bash
# 1. Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bird-bone-ai

# 2. Install additional requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Setup development tools
pre-commit install
dvc init --subdir models
git lfs install

# 4. Validate setup
python scripts/validate_environment.py

import torch
import transformers
print(f'‚úì PyTorch {torch.__version__}')
print(f'‚úì CUDA Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')
print(f'‚úì Transformers {transformers.__version__}')
print('üéâ Ready for bird-bone AI development!')
"
```

*Expect ‚âà 60-70 % resource drop with < 3 % accuracy drift ‚Äî all diff-tracked.*

## üîÑ Pipeline Stages

1. **Baseline Mapping** ‚Äì snapshot initial neural density & structural integrity metrics.
2. **Density Assessment** ‚Äì 2-3 epochs analyzing connection utilization patterns.
3. **Adaptive Decay Wave** ‚Äì remove ‚â§ 10 % lowest-density connections per cycle, simulating natural bone resorption.
4. **Healing Phase** ‚Äì 200-500 QLoRA gradient steps to strengthen remaining pathways.
5. **Structural Reinforcement** ‚Äì targeted connection enhancement in critical load-bearing areas.
6. **Density Redistribution** ‚Äì RigL reallocates up to 5 % connections to optimize strength-to-weight ratio.
7. **Quantize + Low-Rank Merge**.

## üìä Monitor & Guardrails

* Metrics: `ppl`, `MMLU`, `ARC`, domain-specific canaries.
* Stop-loss: pipeline auto-reverts if Œîppl > 3 % for two consecutive waves.
* Healing curves: Jupyter notebook `notebooks/healing.ipynb`; compare via nbdime.
