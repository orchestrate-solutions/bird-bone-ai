# Core ML Foundation Analysis

## PyTorch vs TensorFlow (2025 State)

Based on current research and our biologically-inspired compression needs:

### PyTorch - RECOMMENDED ✅
**Why PyTorch for Bird-Bone AI:**
- **Dynamic Computation Graphs**: Essential for our adaptive pruning algorithms
- **Research-Friendly**: Perfect for bio-inspired experimentation 
- **Hook System**: Critical for weight importance analysis and growth plate detection
- **CUDA Integration**: Excellent H100/A100 support with latest versions
- **Memory Efficiency**: Better control for large model compression

**Latest Stable**: PyTorch 2.4+ with CUDA 12.4 support
**Advantages for Our Use Case:**
- Flexible graph modification during compression
- Easy gradient capture for importance scoring
- Excellent debugging and introspection
- Strong ecosystem for model compression research

### TensorFlow - NOT RECOMMENDED ❌
**Reasons Against:**
- Static graph limitations for dynamic pruning
- Less flexibility for custom compression algorithms
- Overhead for our specific research needs

## Model Handling Libraries

### Transformers (HuggingFace) - ESSENTIAL ✅
**Version**: Latest stable (4.44+)
**Why:**
- Industry standard for model loading/saving
- Excellent integration with PyTorch
- Built-in support for Mistral-7B and other targets
- Active development and community

### Safetensors - RECOMMENDED ✅ 
**Why over pickle:**
- Security: No arbitrary code execution
- Speed: Faster loading/saving
- Memory efficiency: Zero-copy deserialization
- Growing adoption as standard

### Accelerate - ESSENTIAL ✅
**Why:**
- Multi-GPU handling made simple
- Memory-efficient model loading
- Big model inference optimization
- HuggingFace ecosystem integration

## CUDA Strategy

### Target: CUDA 12.4+ (Latest)
**Reasoning:**
- H100/A100 optimization
- Latest performance improvements
- Future-proof for new GPU generations

### PyTorch CUDA Configuration:
```
torch>=2.4.0
