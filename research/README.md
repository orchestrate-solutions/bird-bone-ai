# Research Directory

This directory contains research and analysis for library selection, architectural decisions, and implementation approaches for the Bird-Bone AI project.

## Current Research

### Library Selection Analysis
- **Environment Setup**: Python environment configuration research
- **ML Libraries**: Core machine learning library evaluations
- **Compression Tools**: Quantization and pruning library analysis
- **Development Tools**: Testing and code quality tool selection

## Research Methodology

1. **Data Collection Focus**: Prioritize libraries with excellent observability and logging
2. **Cloud GPU Optimization**: Target H100/A100 with latest CUDA support
3. **Quality First**: Comprehensive evaluation over rapid implementation
4. **Iterative Approach**: 80% solution first, optimize later with collected data
